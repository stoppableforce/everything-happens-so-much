# Everything Happens So Much

A backup of Everything Happens So Much, a Bitsy game available [on itch.io](https://stoppableforce.itch.io/everything-happens-so-much).

So I signed up for the [TwitsyBot Jam](https://itch.io/jam/twitsybot-jam) mostly because it started on my birthday, and I'd never used Bitsy, and it seemed like a fine time for both my first game jam and my first time using Bitsy. On top of that, the theme was to base your game on a Twitter bot, and who better other than the grandfather of all nonsense, [@horse_ebooks](https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks)? 

(Let us not forget that before @horse_ebooks was revealed to have been purchased and manually run by two artists, it was a genuine ebook-hawking .... sort of.... Twitter bot. I'm pretty sure the revelation that @horse_ebooks wasn't a real bot marks the turning point of the darkest timeline.)

So yeah, this was a fun little time, I had some laughs, I hope you do too. Wander a little horse farm and bump into horses to learn their gibberish wisdom. When you're done, the exit's in the northeast.
